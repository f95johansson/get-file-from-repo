# Get File from Repo
Shell script that download a specific file from a git repository. The file will be downloaded to the current folder.  
Currently this script requires a manual installation. Place the script file (`checkout-file`) in a folder which is in your path (`$PATH`), typically `/usr/local/bin`.  

Usage:

```
checkout-file path/to/git/repo.git path/to/file/in/repo
```
